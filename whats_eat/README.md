# whats_eat

This is a flutter application that aims to solve the the world-ending problem of deciding on which place to eat.

Simply add entries of restaurants, and fill in the relevant information such as the price range and the category, and the app will randomize and select a place for you to eat.

Now you no longer need to waste your time and energy arguing with your friends on where to spend your time having dinner!
