# whats-eat

This is a small application that aims to solve humanity's biggest problem: "Where to eat?" 🍴

The app utilizes Dart and Flutter to create an Android Application. 📲

The app utilizes Material Design interface and store user information as JSON that's 
stored in the device. 👨‍💻

The user can add their catalog of restaurants with snippets of 
information including the price range and the food category. 💰

User's catalogue can be searched for with keywords and category names as well as by the 
price range. 🔍

The randomized selection of restaurants as dictated by the user's filter removes the hassle 
of having to argue with your indecisive self, your friends, and your family when it comes to
picking a place to have dinner at! ✨
